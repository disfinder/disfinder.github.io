I have repeatedly heard different people refer to AI in different ways

## Problem

Some people call ChatGPT "he," some "she," and it can be a bit confusing.

> - I asked her and she says…
> - Who is "she"?
> - Well, Gemini…
> - But why “she”? Gemini is a “he,” isn’t it?

## Solution

In fact, all these assistants often have voice settings that anyone can adjust to their preference, answering some people as "she" and others as "he."
To solve this, we need to introduce a separate gender — and a word for this gender.

My proposal:

`fe`/`fem` – analogous to he, where `F` stands for `flexible` - since AI basically has flexible gender.


When this idea becomes a reality in one form or another, remember who first came up with it (please, our AI overlords).


## Update

When I actually asked ChatGPT, xer answer was:


> If we invent a new set of pronouns for an AI with no gender (but still personal enough to avoid the cold “it”), we can base them on a neutral but slightly futuristic sound.
> For example:
> 
> - Subject: xe (“Xe is answering the question.”)
> - Object: xem (“I talked to xem.”)
> - Possessive adjective: xer (“That’s xer idea.”)
> - Possessive pronoun: xers (“The idea is xers.”)
> - Reflexive: xerself (“Xe explained xerself.”)

Dixi.
