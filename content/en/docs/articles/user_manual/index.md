### How you like to receive credit/praise and constructive feedback

Prefer direct and fast feedback - as soon as you see I am doing something wrong - please tell me why.  
However, I most probably will object if I believe I'm following best practices, so woudl appreciate some arguments.

- ping-pong (amateur level)
- playing acoustic guitar (below amateur level)

### Personal development goals

- CKA

## Part 2 (informal)

### What You Should Know About Me

- Born and raised overseas:
  - I use Celsius, not Fahrenheit (but okay with miles and pounds)
  - I am totally unfamiliar with the cultural domain from pre-K/school/college (something you might consider obvious, I have never heard of or seen)
  - English is not my first language:
    - If I say something weird (or even rude), it's most probably unintentional, using the wrong wording, etc
    - I appreciate spelling corrections greatly
    - I love puns and wordplays and do my best to understand them
- I haven't seen Star Wars (sorry, I tried, but that train seems to have passed), Star Trek, and have never read comic books
- I've read a lot of 60s-90s Sci-Fi and fiction literature, including but not limited to authors from the USA
  - What are your top 3 books?
- [I don't drink coffee; I take tea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d27gTrPPAyk)
- I love customization and use shell/git aliases a lot, as well as tiny utilities to make things pretty or colorful (like [grc](https://github.com/garabik/grc) or [kubecolor](https://github.com/hidetatz/kubecolor))

### Fun facts about me

- I'm left-handed
- I was born in the empire/country, which no longer exists - USSR or Soviet Union

### What I consider common sense

- [the one and only data format is YYYY-MM-DD](/perfect-date.png) (you'll agree with me when you try to sort lines/files in another format)
- splittint is much harder than joining (Cinderella was told to sort a pile of seeds and grains, an impossible task, but mixing them together was easy)
- [Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/19905-perfection-is-achieved-not-when-there-is-nothing-more-to)

### Personal opinions about different stuff

- `git push --force` is evil
  - avoid it, unless it is a final step for a long-lasting PR to prettify commits history
  - force-pushes might make PRs of your peers fail
- however, nasty git history is much more evul, so please rebase (squash/fixup) and force-push your branch if you are changing 2 files with 135 commits

### Things I can help you with

- Complex git tricks (rebasing, history rewriting, bisect search, conflict resolution and
avoidance, hooks)
- Python code, including linters/tests, list/dict comprehensions, parameter parsing,
simple CLI scripts, and simple web services (Flask)
- Groovy code (in a limited scope of Jenkins job/library)
- Ansible: I love this tool and use it, for example, to bootstrap/update macOS laptops
to keep the settings consistent across hardware migrations
- Docker: Adopted it since the 0.7.x version when only Linux was supported. I may not be
aware of its latest features, but knowing the underlying principles (lxc, cgroups, namespaces...) helps with troubleshooting

### Things I need help with

- Kubernetes and authentication (IAM, SSO, OAUTH)
- writing documentation (especially style/grammar)

### Things I believe worth reading

[I have a separate article for that](/en/docs/articles/must-read/)
